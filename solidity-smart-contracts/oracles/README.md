## Introduction to Price Feeds <a id="introduction-to-price-feeds"></a>

Chainlink Price Feeds are the quickest way to connect your smart contracts to the real-world market prices of assets. They enable smart contracts to retrieve the latest price of an asset in a single call.

Often, smart contracts need to act upon prices of assets in real-time. This is especially true in [DeFi](https://defi.chain.link/). For example, [Synthetix](https://www.synthetix.io/) use Price Feeds to determine prices on their derivatives platform. Lending and Borrowing platforms like [AAVE](https://aave.com/) use Price Feeds to ensure the total value of the collateral.
