# Deploy

### Setting up the development environment <a id="setting-up-the-development-environment"></a>

There are a few technical requirements before we start. Please install the following: Requirements:

* Windows, Linux or Mac OS X
* [Node.js v8.9.4 LTS or later](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

**Recommendations for Windows**

If you're running Truffle on Windows, you may encounter some naming conflicts that could prevent Truffle from executing properly. Please see the section on resolving naming conflicts for solutions.

### Installing <a id="installing"></a>

Once we have those installed, we only need one command to install Truffle:

```text
npm install -g truffle
```

To verify that Truffle is installed properly, type **`truffle version`** on a terminal. If you see an error, make sure that your npm modules are added to your path.
