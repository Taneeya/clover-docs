# Tutorial

> This work is inspired by [this blog](https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/draft-create-an-nft-and-deploy-to-a-public-testnet-using-truffle/2961)

In this tutorial we will create a non-fungible token \(NFT\) and deploy to a public testnet.

ERC721 is a standard for representing ownership of [non-fungible tokens](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/tokens#different-kinds-of-tokens), that is, where each token is unique such as in real estate or collectibles.

We will use [Presets](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/api/presets) contracts in [OpenZeppelin Contracts](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/) to create an ERC721 and deploy using Truffle.
