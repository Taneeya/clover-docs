# Clover Wallet  browser extension version

## **Introduction**

Clover Wallet is a browser extension designed to make accessing Polkadotâ€™s Dapp ecosystem easier. It also serves as a wallet for holding Polkadot blockchain-based tokens allowing users to access services built on the network via the wallet.

## **How does Clover Wallet work**

Clover wallet works with JavaScript by injecting a Polkadot/api Signer into a page, along with any associated accounts, allowing for use by any DApp. It manages these accounts and allows the signing of transactions with them.

## Installation

## **Buy, store, send and swap tokens**

Available as a browser extension, Clover Wallet equips users with a key vault, secure login, token wallet, and token exchange functionality to manage their digital assets.

## **Explore blockchain apps**

Clover Wallet provides the simplest yet most secure way to connect to Polkadot blockchain-based applications. Users are always in control when interacting on the new decentralized web.

## **Security**

Clover Wallet generates passwords and keys on self-owned devices. So only the users themselves have access to their accounts and data. They can always choose what to share and what to keep private.

## **DeFi SDK for Dapp developers**

Clover Wallet provides an open-source DeFi SDK as well as a platform of smart contracts that makes it easier for developers to integrate with every DeFi product. The DeFi SDK gives the developers instant access to leading DeFi prototals, like Acala, OCEAN, Mantra DAO, Rio DeFi, in the Polkadot ecosystem instead of manually integrating each of them.
