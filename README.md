# Welcome to Clover

This site provides documentation for Clover, an Operating System parachain on the Polkadot network. Here, you'll find both high-level and technical information for developers, collators, end users, and other Clover network participants.

This site will grow and be refined over time as Clover is developed. We welcome you to join the Clover community and contribute to this site and to the project.

## What is Clover

Clover is a Substrate-based Polkadot parachain. Clover is committed to providing easy-to-use blockchain infrastructure and creating a one-stop comprehensive infrastructure platform, which reduce the threshold and cost for developers, and bring great returns to developers. 

### Blockchain Operating System

Clover is a Blockchain Operating System, which contains storage layer, smart contract layer, Defi protocol layer and eApp layer, in details:

* Storage layer: Storage protocol layer supports distributed storage of dApp data. The supported protocols are IPFS, AR, CRUST etc.
* Smart contract layer: It supports one-stop cross-chain deployment and calls of dApp. Clover provides a Web3-compatible API,  and current web3 dApps can be migrated to Clover without any change.
* Defi protocol layer: It supports various basic Defi protocols, such as Swap, Lending, Insurance etc, as well as providing a platform which enables developers to build their own Defi protocols. Also, Clover provides a drag-drop smart contract compiler, which is easy-to-use, faultless and can be compiled to WASM.
* eApp layer: It supports the evolution from dApp to eApp\(External App\),  developers can build and deploy their eApp easily, without the need for machines,  domain names, network bandwidth.

### Built on Substrate

Substrate is a good technical fit for Clover. By building on top of this framework, we can leverage the extensive functionality that Substrate includes out-of-the-box, rather than needing to build it ourselves. This includes peer-to-peer networking, consensus mechanisms, governance functionality, an EVM implementation, and more.

Overall, using Substrate will dramatically reduce the time and implementation effort needed to implement Clover. Substrate allows a great degree of customization, which is necessary in order to achieve our Ethereum compatibility goals. And, by using Rust, we benefit from both safety guarantees and performance gains.
