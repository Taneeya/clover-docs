# Clover User Incentive Program

## Virtual Ethereum chain address binding

  
  
CLV and ETH address Binding is mandatory. Clover will check whether the address is bound every time before a user signs. If the address is unbound, the following process will   be started.

After binding, the CLV assets of the two accounts will be mapped and the data is shared.  


## Transaction fee user incentive model

The rules of user incentive model are:

1. Clover network provides 20,000,000,000 transaction gas every day from eco-incentive fund.
2. Users need to have at least one CLV in their account to get 20 free gas for trading which can not accumulate or transfer.
3. Users can also get gas by freezing CLV token. The amount of gas obtained = 20,000,000,000 \* freezing amount / total freezing amount
4. Users can also pay CLV to get gas directly. The gas price is determined by validators.
5. For transactions and calling contracts, the priorities of the gas usage are
   1. 20 free gas daily
   2. Part obtained by freezing CLV
   3. Part by paying CLV
