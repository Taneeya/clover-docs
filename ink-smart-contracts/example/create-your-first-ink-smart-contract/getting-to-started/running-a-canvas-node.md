# Running a Canvas Node

After successfully installing `canvas`, you can start a local development chain by running:

```text
canvas --dev --tmpCopy to clipboardErrorCopied
```

You should start to see blocks being produced by your node in your terminal.

You can interact with your node using the Canvas UI:

The UI will connect to the locally running node by default.
